        <p>KSHS has a variety of robotics programs spanning across all grades.
        Along with robotics classes we run enter teams into a variety of <a
        href="https://www.firstinspires.org/">FIRST</a> competitions such as FIRST
        Lego League and FIRST Robotics Competition.</p>
        <section>
            <h2>FLL</h2>
            <p>KSHS first competed in FLL in 2018 but after 2019 went dormant for
            multiple years. In 2023 KSHS entered a team for the first time in 4 years
            comprised of a group of year 8s and 9s. This year we have started our
            preparation early and are looking to send multiple teams with students
            ranging from years 7 to 9.</p>

            <h2>FRC</h2>
            <p>This year we also plan to send a team to <a
            href="https://waroboticsplayoffs.com/">WARP</a> to compete in the 2024
            FIRST Robotics competition game. The team will be comprised of older students
            allowing FLL students to transition into it after graduating from the FLL
            program.</p>
